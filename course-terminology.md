# Version control and Java Basics

version control
* Teams of programmers use *version control* to manage changes to source code over time.

repository, git, add, commit, push, pull, clone, fork, "branch-and-merge workflow", pull request
* A repository is a directory that contains your project work, as well as a few files (hidden by default) which are used to communicate with Git.

command line (terminal)
* The command line is an interface that provides us with an alternative way to interact with our devices. Instead of clicking on graphical buttons and icons to launch programs and switch between tabs and windows, you can run instructions to perform these actions by explicitly writing commands to the command line, akin to a programming language.

"Strongly typed language"

method, class, variable, type

constructor
* You call a constructor to instantiate (an object of) a class.

static information vs. instance information (methods and variables)
* Static information belongs to the class itself. A single copy is shared by all instances, and static methods can be called without creating an object.
Instance information belongs to individual objects. Each object has its own copy of instance variables, and instance methods operate on the specific state of the object they are called on.

class vs. instance

instantiate
* You call a constructor to instantiate (an object of) a class.
